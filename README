== Open Chemistry Superbuild ==

This repository provides a git repository that will clone other Open Chemistry
projects on demand, and build them all using the CMake external project
functionality. All Open Chemistry libraries and applications are provided at
the top level, and third party libraries are contained within the TPL
directory.

This superbuild project is provided as a convenience for developers. The
individual projects can be built on their own once all dependencies are
satisfied.

This is a meaningless change.

== Building ==

Create a build directory, cd into the build directory and run,

 cmake path/to/openchemistry
 make
